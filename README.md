🚀 Striver A–Z DSA Sheet Solutions (C++)

Author: Ghost
GitHub: ADRIVID-MISHRA

This repository contains my C++ implementations of Striver’s A–Z DSA Sheet, written while following the sheet exactly in the order and methods taught by Striver.

Each problem includes all approaches shown by Striver (Brute, Better, Optimal) up to the topics I have completed so far.

⚠️ Status: 🚧 Work in Progress
I am solving problems daily, and this repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the sheet.

📌 What This Repository Represents

✅ Faithful implementation of Striver’s A–Z DSA Sheet

✅ All approaches included wherever Striver explains them

✅ Written in C++

✅ Structured exactly by Modules & Lectures

✅ Focused on strong fundamentals & interview readiness

This repo acts as:

A learning log

A revision resource

A placement preparation archive
